xls2ajf compiles [xlsform](http://xlsform.org/en/) excel files to ajf, a json-based format used at gnucoop to describe forms.
The tool can be installed with:

```go get bitbucket.org/gnucoop/xls2ajf```

and used as:

```xls2ajf form1.xlsx form2.xls form3.xls```

xls2ajf implements a subset of the xlsform specification.
Supported features are listed in this document.

## Introduction to xlsforms

[Xlsform](http://xlsform.org/en/) is a standard that allows authoring forms in excel.
A xlsform excel file has two main sheets: "survey" and "choices".
The survey sheet describes the content of the form, while "choices" is used to define answers for single- or multiple-choice questions.
Empty rows and columns are ignored.
A simple example is given below.

Survey sheet:

|type                     |name       |label      |
|-------------------------|-----------|-----------|
|begin group              |info       |General Information |
|text                     |username   |Your name: |
|select_one yes_no        |pizza      |Do you like pizza? |
|select_multiple mealtime |mealtimes  |When do you have pizza? |
|end group                |           |           |

Choices sheet:

|list name |name      |label     |
|----------|----------|----------|
|yes_no    |yes       |Yes       |
|yes_no    |no        |No        |
|mealtime  |breakfast |Breakfast |
|mealtime  |lunch     |Lunch     |
|mealtime  |dinner    |Dinner    |

## Question types

The following table lists the supported question types.

|Question type   |Ajf field type  |Description     |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|
|decimal         |number          |64-bit floating point number |
|text            |string          |Free text response |
|boolean         |boolean         |Boolean answer (a checkbox) |
|select_one      |single choice   |Single choice answer |
|select_multiple |multiple choice |Multiple choice answer |
|note            |empty           |Inserts an HTML note in the form |
|date            |date input      |A date          |
|time            |time            |Time            |

## Required

It is possible to flag questions as required, so that the user won't be able to submit the form without providing a value:

|type      |name      |label     |required  |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|text      |color     |Your favorite color (very important information, mandatory): |yes |

## Grouping

Questions can be grouped, as shown in the [introductory example](#markdown-header-introduction-to-xlsforms); groups can be nested.

Ajf forms have the peculiarity of being organized in slides, which has implications on how groups are handled.
Top-level groups are translated to slides, while inner groups are translated to ajf group nodes.
When the form contains ungrouped questions, the whole form will be wrapped in a single group/slide.

## Repeats

Repeats give the user the possibility to repeat a group of questions:

|type         |name         |label        |repeat_count |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
|begin repeat |child_repeat |Answer the following questions for each one of your childs |20 |
|text         |name         |Child's name |             |
|decimal      |birthweight  |Child's birthweight |      |
|end repeat   |             |             |             |

When specified, `repeat_count` defines an upper bound to how many times the group can be repeated.
Repeats cannot be nested inside other repeats or groups.

## Relevant

The relevant column allows skipping a question or making and additional question appear based on the response to a previous question:

|type               |name      |label             |relevant            |
|-------------------|----------|------------------|--------------------|
|select_one cat_dog |pet_type  |Are you a cat or a dog person? |       |
|text               |cat_name  |Name of your cat: |${pet_type} = "cat" |
|text               |dog_name  |Name of your dog: |${pet_type} = "dog" |

The feature can also be applied to groups.

## Formulas

Formulas are used in the constraint, relevant and calculation columns.
xls2ajf implements a subset of [xlsform formulas](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-operators-functions/).
In particular, the features involving nodesets are omitted, as ajf doesn't have an equivalent concept.

Formulas are expressions composed of constants, question references, operators and functions.
The expressions are parsed and converted to JavaScript.
No semantical analysis is done and the tool may produce invalid JavaScript like `45 + true`.

### Constants

Constants can be numbers, strings (delimited by 'single' or "double" quotes) or booleans (`True` or `False`).

### Question References

To reference the value provided as answer to a question, use the expression `${question_name}`.

### Operators

The following table lists the supported operators with their corresponding JavaScript implementation:

|                |   |   |   |     |     |     |     |   |    |   |    |     |    |
|----------------|---|---|---|-----|-----|-----|-----|---|----|---|----|-----|----|
| Formula op:    |`+`|`-`|`*`|`div`|`mod`|`=`  |`!=` |`>`|`>=`|`<`|`<=`|`and`|`or`|
| JavaScript op: |`+`|`-`|`*`|`/`  |`%`  |`===`|`!==`|`>`|`>=`|`<`|`<=`|`&&` |`||`|

The precedence of operators is as defined by JavaScript operators.
Round parentheses can be used in formulas.
